# String Tutors

[See Live Demo of the site.](https://stringtutor.netlify.app/)

## Overview of the project
String Tutors is an app designed for the Education and Preservation of American Folk music.
The focus is an application where instructors (tutors/mentors) can teach students to play traditional American folk music on stringed instruments, such as mandolin, guitar, bass, fiddle, and banjo.  American folk includes blues, bluegrass, old time, Appalachian folk, and others early American tunes that came over with the settlers (Irish/English reels, hornpipes, jigs) played on these instruments.
